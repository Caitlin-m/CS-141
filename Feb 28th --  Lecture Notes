Searching/Sorting:
  Linear Searching/Sequestial Searching:
      goes through an array starting at zero and goind to the end or until it finds what it's looking for
      * simple
      * easy
      * works on any data
      * SLOW
      * average n/2 comparisons
      * O(n)
   
   Binary Search:
      * more complex
      * 
 Sorting:
    Quick:
    Merge:
    Heap:
