when go clicked a random set of 4 cards are displayed, then count how many pickes/draws are required to get
  a card from each suit
  
ArrayLists ?????
  
under action on the menue bar (statistics):
    1) number of times the game has been played
    2) min number of picks
    3) max number of picks
        i.e:    round 1: took 5 picks
                round 2: took 7 picks
                round 3: took 14 picks
                round 4: took 9 picks
                round 5: took 10 picks
    4) mean average ( all picks added together / number of rounds) ((5+7+14+9+10)/5 = 45/5 = 9)
    5) median = middle value ( dort from smallest to largest then pick middle number)( 5, 7, 9, 10, 14 = 9)
         if two numbers in the middle take the average of the two
    6) mode: most frequent occurance (number (of picks) that repeats the most)
    7) standard deviation (measures how much the mean, median, and mode differ)
             |   x1   |   x1-mean     |  (x1-mean)^2  |
             |--------|---------------|---------------|
             |   5    |   5-9   = -4  |  (-4)^2 = 16  |
             |   7    |   7-9   = -2  |  (-2)^2 = 4   |
             |   14   |   14-9  = 5   |  (5)^2  = 25  |
             |   9    |   9-9   = 0   |  (0)^2  = 0   |
             |   10   |   10-9  = 1   |  (1)^2  = 1   |
             |--------|---------------|---------------|
             |   45   |       0       |   sqrt(46/4)  |
        when statistics button pused make sure that the game has been played more than once, if not
          display message saying that the game needs to be played more than once

start with all four cards face down

array lists in section 7.11 of book

re-name all card pictures to incluse face and number

save button: save results of all players and not just current player???

to generate new cards: shuffle the deck each time then pick just the top 4, or pick a random int then take 
  corisponding card in array
  once all four suits are displayed reset the deck
