Final exam will cover:
  chapter 1-8 from book
  5 write code problems
    one will be a write code for a linear or binary search
    one will be a code to write an arrya to generate random integers, and the doing something to that array (like find the mean,
      or median)
  50 points for multiple choice
  10 for write code (if only doins 2 point questions)
      

SORTING:
  Binary searching: O(log_2(n))
    more complex
    much faster
    data must be sorted
    
  Slow: O(n^2)
    bubble
    insertion
    selection
    
  Slow: O(log_2(n))
    quick
    merege
    heap
    
  Hashing:  O(1)
    fastest
    has problems with colision
    
Sorting Algorithems:
  bubble sorting:
    start with the first element(i) and then compare it to the next(j) if i is greater than i j is moved into i place, and contnues
      if i is less than j, j is compared to the next number, and so on

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
  (9 loops to sort 10 numbers)
  
  insertion sorting:
    works in the opposit direction of bubble sorting
    start with the array(0) and then compare it to the array(1) if array(1) has a value less than array(0) then they switch positions
    if array(3) is greater than array(0) and array(1), then is moves to array(0), and so on
