Still meating on Monday

remember icon for Project 3

two prints, players staticstics and print the GUI

save is the same as printing the statistics just with saving it to a text file
    playerName_stasticts_date.txt
    
arrays.sort allowed

Open not required but is extra credit (opens a players save file)

in tests folder, review old quizes and exams

Multiple-Subscripted(Multi-Dimensional) Arrays

technicaly speaking java has no Multi-Dimensional arrays, just arrays of arrays

   _0___1___2___3_
0 |___|___|___|___|
1 |___|___|___|___|
2 |___|___|___|___|

"Multi-Dimensional"                 
|_0_| ------------> |_1_|_2_|         = Array 1
|_1_| ------------> |_a_|_b_|_c_|_d_| = Array 2
|_2_|-------------> |_!_|_@_|_#_|_$_| = Array 3
each item in the "Multi-Dimensional" array references another array also called a "Jagged" array

Multi-Dimensional[2].length = 4
Multi-Dimensional[1]/length = 2
Multi-Dimensional.length = 3

Best thing about arrays: instant acess to an element
Worst thing about arrays: must be assigned continously in memory

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Array Lists:

to initiliaze:
  ArrayList myArrayList = new ArrayList()

Special because you can change the capacity and size of the array

do not have a length propery, instead they have a size

myArrayList(5) = capacity of 5
myArrayList.size(5) = size of 5
myArrayList(5) â‰  myArrayList.size(5)

To print the content of a ArrayList
  System.out.println("Content of myArrayList: " + myArrayList);
  
To add an item to an ArrayList:
  myArrayList.add(whatever)

To delete an item from an Arraylist:
  myArrayList.remove("F"); Removes the first occurance of F
  myArrayList.remove(2); Removes the item at index 2
  
To retreive an item:
  myArrayList.get(index number);
    comes back as an object, not the origional type of the item

You can copy and ArrayList to an Array and then sort  with:
  Array = myArrayList.toArray()
  Arrays.sort(Array)
  
An ArrayList can have integers, strings, chars, and booleans but it then cannot be cast into an 
  Array, so sorting becomes a problem
