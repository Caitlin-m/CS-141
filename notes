PROJECT 3
    shuffle cards
    pick card
    Keep track of the number of times the games is played and provide statistics 
        (via menu choice) for mean, median and standard deviation
    Provide statistics for the game.It might include simulation of the game n times 
        (n = 1, 10, 100, 1000, ..., orwhatever valid number the user selects), with mean, 
        median, and standard deviation
    look over vb card game done for vb final

pt 1.
    calculate square root
    hint: see Programming Exercise 6.22
    Write a Java GUI program that gets a positivereal numberfrom the user and
        then displays the square root of the number using the Babylonian method 
        for calculating the square root of that number
    % error = (|exact - approximate|/exact) * 100
         i.e. sqrt(135348) = exact(354.04519....) =~ approximate(354.045)
         (|354.04519-354.045|/354.04519) * 100 =~ % 0.00005506
    
pt. 2
    Add to the program in Problem Statement I by providing a second method, 
        the Bakhshali method,for calculating the square root of a positive real number.
        Compare the two methods for convergence.
